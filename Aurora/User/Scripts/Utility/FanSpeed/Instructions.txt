This is a very simple script, it took me 10 minutes to write.

That being said, the only important line in the script that needs edited is the

FanSpeedPercent= line. I default it to 75% though this can be changed to any value between 0 and 100, I would not suggest going under 55%.

That being said, I only did this to show 2 things

1. That Team Phoenix has given people more options than they ever dreamed, if they just learn some basic programming. 
2. That the Whining people(You Know Who You Are) who keep going on about Fan Speed settings in aurora were not forgotten with the LUA scripting.

All that being said, it would still be smarter to write a script that sets target temps, as that is actually saved to SMC_Config, and will apply every time you reboot. As it is with this version of aurora, you will need to run this script everytime you reboot.

Enjoy.
