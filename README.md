# ABadAvatarHDD-rain2591

ABadAvatarHDD is a HEX modified copy of ABadAvatar by Shutterbug (https://github.com/shutterbug2000/ABadAvatar) which is based on BadUpdate by Grimdoomer (https://github.com/grimdoomer/Xbox360BadUpdate)

ABadAvatarHDD is run from the Xbox360 Internal HDD instead of having to be run off of a USB stick, means no more USB sticks protruding from your system.

All stage and profile files are HEX modified to point to the HDD locations instead of MASS, all files in this github are tested and ready to go, included within the package are all the files to get your Xbox360 running straight to Aurora.

Included all ready to go in the package and setup.

(28/09/2025 14:29) - Added new download at (https://github.com/rain2591/badavatarHDD-rain2591/releases/tag/HelperUSBXDON) this is a barebones ABadAvatar for USB to aid those that want to be able to add ABadAvatarHDD to the internal Xbox360 hard drive, this barebones also includes just XDON so you can connect to your Xbox360 using FatExplorer 3.0 beta. What is XDON?
XDON (Xbox Disk Over Network) is an app that runs on your Xbox that exposes storage devices over the network. It provides the ability to perform IO operations at a raw level using a simple protocol.
When you wanted direct disk access in the past, you would have to remove your storage device from your console and connect it to your PC. With XDON, you can now leave your storage device in place and interact with it at network speeds.
XDON is available for both the Original Xbox and Xbox 360.

(24/09/2025 16:26) - Removed release 1.00 as it had a obsolete .bak backup of the profile in the content folder and showing 2 profiles in the hard drive, if you have issues remove the previous release and use 1.01

(24/09/2025 15:47) - Note that when you extract the package that you are left with a folder called "badavatarHDD-rain2591-1.01" for example, the contents inside this folder is what should be copied to your Xbox360 Hard Drive to work, please do not place the folder named "badavatarHDD-rain2591-1.01" straight onto the hard drive as the Xbox360 will not see them but copy those files within "badavatarHDD-rain2591-1.01" to the root of Hard Drive.

Aurora 0.7b.2 (https://phoenix.xboxunity.net/)
Proto V2.4 (https://www.freestealth.com/)
XeUnshackle 1.03 Autostart (https://github.com/Byrom90/XeUnshackle/pull/54)
AbadAvatarHDD (https://github.com/rain2591/badavatarHDD-rain2591/)
NXE Aurora Skin (https://www.realmodscene.com/index.php?/topic/18985-auroranxe-nxe-skin-layout-for-aurora-07b/)

No messing about with launch.ini as by default it is setup ready to go

1) Drag the files into your Xbox360 Internal Hard Drive with what ever method you like
2) Power on your Xbox360 and wait for ABadAvatarHDD to load into Aurora Dashboard
3) Configure your Content Paths to add your games to the Aurora Dashboard
4) Play ;)
5) Incase your X360 s not up to date then ensure your console has the Avatar update data. If you don't have an HDD, you may need to install the official offline System Update 17559 on a formatted USB.

*IMPORTANT NOTE*

If Proto server plugin is enabled as it is by default then Original Xbox games will fail to load so make sure you edit the Launch.ini in the root of the Xbox360 Hard Drive.

1) Open launch.ini in root of your Xbox360 hard drive
2) Scroll down to the section that says [PLUGINS] and go to plugin number 2 and place a ; at beginning of line so it reads as ;plugin2 = Hdd:\Aurora\Plugins\Proto.xex instead of plugin2 = Hdd:\Aurora\Plugins\Proto.xex
3) Save the file and load Xbox360 and Proto plugin will be disabled so you can play Xbox Original games.
