# badavatarHDD-rain2591

ABadAvatarHDD is a HEX modified copy of Abadavatar by Shutterbug (https://github.com/shutterbug2000/ABadAvatar) which is based on BadUpdate by Grimdoomer (https://github.com/grimdoomer/Xbox360BadUpdate)

AbadAvatarHDD is run from the Xbox360 Internal HDD instead of having to be run off of a USB stick, means no more USB sticks protruding from your system.

All stage and profile files are HEX modified to point to the HDD locations instead of MASS, all files in this github are tested and ready to go, included within the package are all the files to get your Xbox360 running straight to Aurora.

Included all ready to go in the package and setup:

Aurora 0.7b.2 (https://phoenix.xboxunity.net/)
Proto V2.4 (https://www.freestealth.com/)
XeUnshackle 1.03 Autostart (https://github.com/Byrom90/XeUnshackle/pull/54)
AbadAvatarHDD (https://github.com/rain2591/badavatarHDD-rain2591/)
NXE Aurora Skin (https://www.realmodscene.com/index.php?/topic/18985-auroranxe-nxe-skin-layout-for-aurora-07b/)

No messing about with launch.ini as by default it is setup ready to go

1) Drag the files into your Xbox360 Internal Hard Drive with what ever method you like
2) Power on your Xbox360 and wait for ABadAvatarHDD to load into Aurora Dashboard
3) Configure your Content Paths to add your gams to the Aurora Dashboard
4) Play ;)

**Credit to "b3ncs1" on Reddit for originally authoring these HEX edits and beat me to it as i had HEX the payloads but hit a wall when i editing the profile and it kept returning as corrupted on the Xbox360, sadly he pulled the plug as he uploaded them to X360hub for testing and they were leaked before they were officially available but gave them to me officially on Reddit along with insights on how to edit in future in case of future payload updates by Grimdoomer. Hours of play testing games and runing the Xbox360 system to check for issues and cant say that i came across any of them.
